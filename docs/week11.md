# ENVIRONMENTAL STORYTELLING PLAYTESTING

## Playtest Environmental Storytelling games
Tonight we are going to playtest as many games as possible. We'll finish up at the start of class next week, if necessary.

As a reminder, games should take no longer than 30 minutes to play. 

# Homework

## Document Environmental Storytelling Project
For your project, create an itch.io page which includes…

### Description
This ia a short text-based description of the game, including:
1. A synopsis of the narrative experience you've created
2. Details on how the game is played 
3. Information on the player's goal(s) and motivations
4. A general overview of the objects that you chose or made

### Photographic documentation
Include 5-8 images of your game’s various objects and of it being played. Curate and edit the images so that they...
1. Look good 
2. Clearly show your game's physical components
2. Highlight the interesting things about your project which you are describing with the text above

### Video documentation
Please provide a 60-90 second video documentation of your game being played. If you are demonstrating your own game, please make sure to set your camera up in a stationary position or use a tripod. Otherwise, I would encourage you to document _other people_.

Upload the video to Youtube and [embed the video](https://www.wikihow.com/Embed-a-YouTube-Video) into your itch.io page.


__Note: team-based projects should be hosted by _each team member_ on itch.io.__

### What to turn in and where
Submit the URL to your itch.io page to this week's assignment in Canvas.


## Play Modern Graphical/Point & Click Adventure Games
Over the next two weeks, choose one of the games below to play for at least one hour.
- [Kentucky Route Zero](http://kentuckyroutezero.com/) by Cardboard Computer
- [Norco](https://rawfury.com/games/norco/) by Geography of Robots

_Both of these games are on the Game Lab PC's Steam account, but you are welcome to purchase them for your own research as well._

## Game Analysis 2 (Due next week)
For this assignment, you will write a brief analysis of Maniac Mansion or Myst and the modern text games you played (Kentucky Route Zero and Norco). Please don’t summarize the games. Instead, use your word count to talk about:

- What is notable about the modern games you played from a design standpoint?
- What differences do you observe between these three games? What do they say about how the genre has changed over time?
- What are their similarities? Why do you think these aspects have remained as part of the genre?
- In what ways is one game more effective than the other?
- How do the design goals (not the game play goals) differ between the games? Why do you think the designers chose those?

## Upcoming
- __11/15 @ 2pm in BBOX__: Practice & Pie networking event (People from Firaxis and Zenimax will be participating). _Be sure to register with Career Development beforehand!_
