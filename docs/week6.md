# CASCADING STYLE SHEETS FOR INK
Today we're going to focus on some of the web-specific features that will allow you to change the appearance of your web exported projects.

### CSS cheatsheet

## Review Interactive Fiction Game outlines together
Find a partner or two and take turns sharing your Ink story outlines (which should be playable, even though they are not complete). 

You can have people play your game through on your own computer. You do not need to play through all endings and you do not need to spend more than 10 minutes playing (in case someone has already exceeded the 10-15 minute maximum limit!)

After you play, write these things down and discuss with the author:
- Succinct description of the plot for the game you just played.
- Which ending did you arrive at?
- Did you encounter any issues that hindered/affected your playthrough? Anything unclear?
- Something you enjoyed or found interesting

## Work session
Work on your Interactive Fiction games. I'm here to test and provide feedback as needed. Just ask!

# Homework

# Upcoming Events

## This Saturday: IGDA District Arcade
I was able to secure a table at next Saturday's IGDA District Arcade event in Silver Springs to show off some student games. Let me know if you're interested in participating and have transportation to get there and back. More info [here](https://www.meetup.com/igda-dc/events/295326258/).

_I'll also be there showing an arcade prototype I've been working on!_

## STEM Festival Opening Event (Oct 12th)
We've also been invited to participate in the opening event for the MD STEM Festival on the evening of October 12th at Howard County Community College. 

They're looking for any interested students who want to demo their games at the event and they will pay for an Uber/Lyft if you don't have your own transportation. [link](https://marylandstemfestival.org/events/maryland-stem-festival-2023-opening-ceremony).
