# EXPORTING INK TO ITCH.IO

## Exporting Ink to web & uploading to itch.io
We're going to export your games to itch.io together at the start of class. 

Here's a guide to exporting your Ink story/game to web and uploading it to itch.io ([link](./assets/documents/uploading-inky-to-itchio.md)).

## Tonight: submit your itch.io links
After testing your uploaded files to ensure that they work, post your itch.io link to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A-nU9phWl5cILmkdghR3eN6hvqfqUtD7cC_I84Eh49w/edit?usp=sharing).

__Important:__ Please set visibility & access to Public and keep comments on (under Community) for this playtest. You can change this to Restricted later. __People will not be able to leave comments if the itch.io page is restricted.__

## Review/playtest finished Text Game prototypes
Let's play your games!
- Share your links (and passwords)
- Play as many games in the browser as time allows and __leave feedback for the designer in the itch.io comments.__
- wewill follow up with discussion, time permitting.

### Guidelines for feedback
Here are some simple guidelines for feedback:
- Briefly summarize the plot for the game you just played.
- Describe the ending did you received.
- Note any issues that hindered/affected your playthrough, or anything else that was unclear.
- Describe one memorable moment. Something you enjoyed or found interesting.


# Homework

### Now what?? 
Take notes. What did you like? Dislike? Something that caused a reaction in you? Something you didn't understand? Favorite moments?

__Come to class next week with a an open-ended discussion question related to your experiences playing the game.__ I'm not collecting these, we'll just be talking.
