# Standard Patterns in Choice-based Games

## Discuss this week's Interactive Fiction selections
- Break into small groups (3-4 people) and discuss the 3 games you played for homework.
- Use your notes and open-ended questions to drive the discussion.
- Share out as a larger group. 

## Standard Patterns in Choice-Based Games
Let's talk about some common structural patterns for interactive fiction (and other choice-based game narratives). We'll use [this great resource](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/standard-patterns-in-choice-based-games/) by Sam Kabo Ashwell as a jumping off point.

### Cheatsheet for Ink
Here is a [cheatsheet](./assets/documents/ink-basics-cheatsheet.md) which will be updated to include all things Ink that we cover in this class. The [Ink Manual](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md) is also great and I would highly recommend getting comfortable with it to find examples of advanced Ink usage.

Today, we'll be focusing on the basics:
- Stitches (subsections)
- Glue <>
- Gather marks -
- Conditional choices { }
- Global variables
- Counting turns


# Homework

## Project 1: Interactive Fiction

### Project Description
For this project, you will create a text-only short game with Ink that takes 10-15 minutes to play at most. Your game should have at least three significant endings, but subject matter is up to you to decide. 

_Don’t spend too much time thinking about the perfect concept (masterpiece syndrome). Experimenting with structure and trying things out are more important than the originality of your premise._

Full project description [here](/docs/assets/documents/text-game-outline.md).

## Finish reading the first part of Chapter 4 in Wonderbook
Over the next two weeks, please set aside time to read the first half of Chapter 4 of Wonderbook (pages 133-157): “Introduction,” “Plot,” “Structure,” “Creating Scenes,” and “Pacing: Beats and Progressions”.
