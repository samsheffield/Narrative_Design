# EXPORTING INK TO ITCH.IO

## Exporting Ink to web & uploading to itch.io
We're going to export your games to itch.io together at the start of class. 

Here's a guide to exporting your Ink story/game to web and uploading it to itch.io ([link](./assets/documents/uploading-inky-to-itchio.md)).

## Tonight: submit your itch.io links
In addition to adding the completed ink file to the online working folder you created for this project...
1. Submit the itch.io link to tonight's assignment in Canvas.
2. Post the itch.io link in our class Discord channel.

__Important:__ Please keep comments on for this playtest.

### Passwords
If you've chosen to publish your game on itch.io as Restricted, please don't forget to provide a password to view in both places.

- Leave the password in a comment on the assignment page in Canvas
- Share the password on Discord along with the game's itch.io link

## Review/playtest finished Text Game prototypes
Let's play your games!
- Share your links (and passwords on the Discord)
- Play as many games in the browser as time allows and __leave feedback for the designer in the itch.io comments.__

__Note: People will not be able to leave comments if the itch.io page is private.__

### Guidelines for feedback
We'll stick to our simple guidelines from last week:
- Briefly summarize the plot for the game you just played.
- Describe the ending did you received.
- Note any issues that hindered/affected your playthrough, or anything else that was unclear.
- Describe one memorable moment. Something you enjoyed or found interesting.


# Homework

## Read the first part of Chapter 4 in Wonderbook
Read the first half of Chapter 4 of Wonderbook (pages 133-157):“Introduction,” “Plot,” “Structure,” “Creating Scenes,” and “Pacing: Beats and Progressions”.

## Text Game Analysis (Due next week)
For this assignment, you will write a brief analysis of Colossal Cave Adventure and one of the modern text games you played (Galatea, Birdland, A kiss, etc.). Please don’t summarize either game you’ve played. Instead, use your word count to talk about:

- What is notable about the modern game you played from a design standpoint?
- What differences do you observe between these two games? What do they say about how the genre has changed over time?
- What are their similarities? Why do you think these aspects have remained as part of the genre?
- In what ways is one game more effective than the other?
- How do the design goals (not the game play goals) differ between the two games? Why do you think the designers chose those?

### Length
There is no strict requirement for length, but as a guideline, try to limit it to 250 words or fewer.

### What to turn in and where
Export your analysis as a PDF and upload it to the Canvas Text Game Analysis assignment.
