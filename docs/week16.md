# PROJECT WORK SESSION

## Work on Final Project (25%)
This is a freeform narrative assignment of your own choosing. It can be non-digital, interactive fiction, or something built in Unity/Unreal. 

_You must work with at least one other person unless you are creating web-based interactive fiction or a small physical game._

### Playtest & Discuss Final Projects
Let's take a look at your games!
1. Please share the URL to your itch.io page on the class Discord
2. Play games and leave feedback in the itch.io comments.
3. Discuss afterwards as a group
