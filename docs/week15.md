# PROJECT WORK SESSION

## Work on Final Project (25%)
This is a freeform narrative assignment of your own choosing. It can be non-digital, interactive fiction, or something built in Unity/Unreal. 

_You must work with at least one other person unless you are creating web-based interactive fiction or a small physical game._

#### Playtest prototypes
A playable prototype of your game is due for in-class playtesting with your peers. Let's playtest any games that are ready for testing.

# Homework

#### Game uploaded to itch.io (Due: Next week)
Upload your completed game to an itch.io page (for non-digital games, we will follow a similar set of guidelines to the Environmental Storytelling project). _Share that URL in the related Canvas assignment._

#### Documentation (Due: Sunday, 12/17)
- 5-8 images of your game, which may include screenshots.
- Physical game: include a 60-90 second edited video of the game being played. _Share the URL to a Google Drive documentation folder in the related Canvas assignment._
