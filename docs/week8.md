# ENVIRONMENTAL STORYTELLING & THE QUIET YEAR

## Environmental Storytelling
Environmental storytelling is an approach to narrative design that relies on describing a space and the objects contained within it. It asks the question, “what happened here?" 

Tonight's notes on environmental storytelling are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-b6vp10qu4AGlz0Pno9utzd5_peJ8TnUL-drSOp5MQA/edit#heading=h.lx2krwwf5hsp).

 ## Play Avery Alder's The Quiet Year
 This game can take anywhere between 2-4 hours to play, so be sure to play by the Fleeting Year rules: 
 
 _Before play, remove 5 cards from each suit. Make sure to remove the King of Diamonds(Summer), and make sure to keep the King of Spades(Winter) in the cards you play with._
