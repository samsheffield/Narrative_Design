# WELCOME BACK

## Exploring Media in Web-based Ink Games
Today we're going to focus on some of the web-specific features that will allow you to do things like incorporate audiovisual media or connect to external websites.

### Cheatsheet for Ink
Here is a [cheatsheet](./assets/documents/ink-basics-cheatsheet.md) which has been updated to include all things Ink that we covered in class.

Today, we'll be focusing on the basics:
- Tags
- CLEAR and RESTART
- IMAGE (Adding images)
- AUDIO & AUDIOLOOP


### Media files for the demo

## Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for Ink
CSS is the language used to style HTML documents in a web browser. It can be used to change the appearance of your web exported projects created with Ink.

### Editing CSS
You can use a basic text editor like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac, but you might find it more enjoyable to use something more powerful like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### CSS cheatsheet
CSS is exhaustively documented online. Some notes specific to our needs with Ink are available [here](./assets/documents/css-cheatsheet.md)

## Some Things to Look Out For!
- Tags will not work in the Inky editor.
- Images don't accurately determine length of game displayed in the browser and can quickly become cut off (How to fix: Page Breaks).
- Exporting for Web will replace all files in the exported folder. Use Export Story.js option instead to make changes.
- Changes to audio not working? Try restarting the Ink game or closing/re-opening the webpage.

## Environmental Storytelling
Environmental storytelling is an approach to narrative design that relies on describing a space and the objects contained within it. It asks the question, â€œwhat happened here?" 

Tonight's notes on environmental storytelling are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-b6vp10qu4AGlz0Pno9utzd5_peJ8TnUL-drSOp5MQA/edit#heading=h.lx2krwwf5hsp).

# Homework

## Expand on Environmental Storytelling Exercise
Create a small game in Ink which uses the image (or images) and prompt you generated tonight as a starting point. You may add additional images/photos and audio that you create (or that you have permission to use!)


### Design Considerations:
- The game may have multiple endings but beware of time.
- The game must be playable in under 15 minutes.
- Create a plot summary and an outline using the tool of your choice. _You will turn this in next week._
- In the outline, indicate emotional beats and places where choices may be made.
- Do not use copyright or unlicensed materials (images, songs, etc.) _If you do, you will not receive credit for this assignment._
- Use CSS to change the basic appearance of your game. Experiment with background colors and fonts which feel appropriate to your game's theme and tone.


### What to Turn In
Create a folder which includes the following:
- Exported web project folder.
- Your game's outline and plot summary*.

*If you do the outlining in Milanote or some other software: 
- You can share the URL in Canvas (if possible)
- You can export the outline and plot summary to a PDF and upload the file to the Canvas site.

If you use paper for outlining:
- Take a high resolution picture of the plot summary and outline and upload the file(s) to the Canvas site
