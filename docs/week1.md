# W E L C O M E ! !
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Say hello! (Who are you? How have you been? What are you excited/nervous about this semester?)
- Discuss this class and set expectations (Syllabus review)
- Join the MGL Discord Server
- Plan for our next meeting


## Before you leave
1. Join the MGL Discord (if you aren't already there). 
    - [Here's the invitation link](https://discord.gg/hpGgwpX8sQ).
    - **If you are new to the server: You will need to visit the #welcome-and-rules channel to view the code of conduct and click the star emote to unlock the rest of the server.**
    - Make sure your server nickname is representative of your name in this class (and presumably outside of this class!) 
    - Here's a link if you don't know how: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames
2. Head to the #narrative-design-f23 channel in the Fall 23 Classes category and say _hello!_ so I can assign you a role.
    - I'll be switching it to a private channel after we're all checked in.
    - If you forgot to set your nickname, you'll get a message back from me asking you to do so right away.

## This Friday: Game Night at the MICA Game Lab! 6-9 PM
Let's kick off the new school year with a game night hosted by the MICA Game Lab! Join us for a night of good games,good  snacks, and good times. Check out our lab's impressive collection of tabletop and multiplayer video games, or bring your own favorites to play with new and old friends. 

All students are welcome, so invite your friends!

## Next Monday (09/04) 12-6:30 pm: Labor Day Game Jam.

MICA Start is hosting a small game jam for all students in the Game Lab (D220) on Labor Day. Sounds like a great opportunity to meet some new people, learn about MICA Start, and shake off some of that summertime rust from your Unity skills. 

Or maybe make a card game? Or a game about whispering outside? How about an "actually fun" ice breaker that we can use in classes? No experience needed. 

Help spread the word!
