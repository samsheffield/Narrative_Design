# W E L C O M E ! !
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Say hello! (Who are you? How have you been? What are you excited/nervous about this semester?)
- Discuss this class and set expectations (Syllabus review)
- Join the MGL Discord Server
- Plan for our next meeting


## Two truths and a lie
As a way of saying hello and starting to get to know one another, you'll tell us your name, pronouns, and major/minor and then...

_You will lie to us. Twice._

Tell us three things about yourself. Two are lies, one is true. We'll guess which is true and then you can choose the next person to introduce themself.

## What's this class?
We'll go over the syllabus together, which will hopefully be informative, but also hopefully the most boring thing we do this semester.


## Before you leave
1. Join the MGL Discord (if you aren't already there). 
    - [Here's the invitation link](https://discord.gg/hpGgwpX8sQ).
    - **If you are new to the server: You will need to visit the #welcome-and-rules channel to view the code of conduct and click the star emote to unlock the rest of the server.**
    - Make sure your server nickname is representative of your name in this class (and presumably outside of this class!) 
    - Here's a link if you don't know how: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames
2. Head to the #narrative-design-f23 channel in the Fall 23 Classes category and say _hello!_ so I can assign you a role.
    - I'll be switching it to a private channel after we're all checked in.
    - If you forgot to set your nickname, you'll get a message back from me asking you to do so right away.

# Homework

## Install the Inky editor
Install the Inky editor to your laptop before class next week. You can find Mac and PC downloads [here](http://www.github.com/inkle/inky/releases/latest).

## Play Interactive Fiction samples
We'll begin talking about a specific genre of narrative game next week called Interactive Fiction, focusing on a selection of historical and contemporary examples. Here are a couple to get us started with.


### Colossal Cave Adventure (1976)
Play William Crowther's seminal Interactive Fiction (IF) game, Colossal Cave Adventure. There is an online port of the game which you can play [here](https://grack.com/demos/adventure/).

_You do not need to play to completion, but please play for at least 30 minutes._

### Play either Counterfeit Monkey (2012) or Galatea (2000)
Play one of Emily Short's modern interactive fiction games, [Counterfeit Monkey]((https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=aearuuxv83plclpl)) or [Galatea](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=urxrv27t7qtu52lb).

_You do not need to play to completion, but please play for at least 1 hour._

_You can also play both of these if you like!_


### If you need help with these games...
Feeling stuck? Parser games such as these can be a little confusing at first. [Here](/docs/assets/documents/play-if-card.pdf) is a handy IF-for-beginners visual guide by Andrew Plotkin and Leah Albaugh that may help.

### Now what??
Take notes. What did you like? Dislike? Find interesting? Favorite moments? We'll play some more games next week and you will use this as part of your first writing assignment (a reflection).


# Upcoming Events

## This Friday: Game Night at the MICA Game Lab! 6-9 PM
Let's kick off the new school year with a game night hosted by the MICA Game Lab! Join us for a night of good games,good  snacks, and good times. Check out our lab's impressive collection of tabletop and multiplayer video games, or bring your own favorites to play with new and old friends. 

All students are welcome, so invite your friends!

## Next Monday (09/04) 12-6:30 pm: Labor Day Game Jam.

MICA Start is hosting a small game jam for all students in the Game Lab (D220) on Labor Day. Sounds like a great opportunity to meet some new people, learn about MICA Start, and shake off some of that summertime rust from your Unity skills. 

Or maybe make a card game? Or a game about whispering outside? How about an "actually fun" ice breaker that we can use in classes? No experience needed. 

Help spread the word!
