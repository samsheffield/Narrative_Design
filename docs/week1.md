# W E L C O M E ! !
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Say hello! (Who are you? How have you been? What are you excited/nervous about this semester?)
- Discuss this class and set expectations ([Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xL_CS4wk_TjH_3da6D6Ip5wgAo8To_NzFEVaRYefNCw/edit?usp=sharing) review)
- Plan for our next meeting
- [Bronzemurder](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/v0.31:Stories/Bronzemurder): A [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) Tale by Tim Denee


## Two lies and a truth
As a way of saying hello and starting to get to know one another, you'll tell us your name, pronouns, and major/minor and then...

_You will lie to us. Twice._

Tell us three things about yourself. Two are lies, one is true. We'll guess which is true and then you can choose the next person to introduce themself.

## What's this class?
We'll go over the syllabus together, which will hopefully be informative, but also hopefully the most boring thing we do this semester.


## Before you leave
1. Join the MGL Discord (if you aren't already there). 
    - [Here's the invitation link](https://discord.gg/AY7SEtn6).
    - **If you are new to the server: You will need to visit the #welcome-and-rules channel to view the code of conduct and click the star emote to unlock the rest of the server.**
    - Make sure your server nickname is representative of your name in this class (and presumably outside of this class!) 
    - Here's a link if you don't know how: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames

# Homework

## Install the Inky editor
Install the Inky editor to your laptop before class next week. You can find Mac and PC downloads [here](http://www.github.com/inkle/inky/releases/latest).

## Purchase Textbook
Please have a copy of Wonderbook by next week. Amazon currently has it for $15.99. There will be reading assignments periodically throughout the semester.We'll also keep a copy in the Game Lab (D220).

## Play Interactive Fiction samples
We'll begin talking about a specific genre of narrative game next week called Interactive Fiction, focusing on a selection of historical and contemporary examples. Here are a couple to get us started with.


### Colossal Cave Adventure (1976)
Play William Crowther's seminal Interactive Fiction (IF) game, Colossal Cave Adventure. There is an online port of the game which you can play [here](https://grack.com/demos/adventure/).

_You do not need to play to completion, but please play for at least 1 hour._

Also, the puzzles in this game can be... frustrating. Don't get too wrapped up in them unless that's really something you enjoy. In fact, [here's a walkthrough of the game](https://adventuregamers.com/walkthrough/full/colossal-cave) (you can find others online too). This is not a challenge to your _gamer cred_.

### Play Galatea (2000)
Play Emily Short's [Galatea](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=urxrv27t7qtu52lb).

_You do not need to play to completion, but please play for at least 1 hour._


### If you need help with these games...
Feeling stuck? Parser games such as these can be a little confusing at first. [Here](https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/play-if-card.html) is a handy IF-for-beginners visual guide by Andrew Plotkin and Leah Albaugh that may help.

### Now what?? 
Take notes. What did you like? Dislike? Something that caused a reaction in you? Somethingn you didn't understand? Favorite moments?

__Come to class next week with a an open-ended discussion question related to each of the games you played.__ I'm not collecting these, we'll just be talking.
