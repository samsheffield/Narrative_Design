# W E L C O M E ! !
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Say hello! (Who are you? How have you been? What are you excited/nervous about this semester?)
- Discuss this class and set expectations (Syllabus review)
- Join the MGL Discord Server
- Plan for our next meeting
- [Bronzemurder](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/v0.31:Stories/Bronzemurder): A [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) Tale by Tim Denee


## Two truths and a lie
As a way of saying hello and starting to get to know one another, you'll tell us your name, pronouns, and major/minor and then...

_You will lie to us. Twice._

Tell us three things about yourself. Two are lies, one is true. We'll guess which is true and then you can choose the next person to introduce themself.

## What's this class?
We'll go over the syllabus together, which will hopefully be informative, but also hopefully the most boring thing we do this semester.


## Before you leave
1. Join the MGL Discord (if you aren't already there). 
    - [Here's the invitation link](https://discord.gg/hpGgwpX8sQ).
    - **If you are new to the server: You will need to visit the #welcome-and-rules channel to view the code of conduct and click the star emote to unlock the rest of the server.**
    - Make sure your server nickname is representative of your name in this class (and presumably outside of this class!) 
    - Here's a link if you don't know how: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames
2. Head to the #narrative-design-f23 channel in the Fall 23 Classes category and say _hello!_ so I can assign you a role.
    - I'll be switching it to a private channel after we're all checked in.
    - If you forgot to set your nickname, you'll get a message back from me asking you to do so right away.

# Homework

## Install the Inky editor
Install the Inky editor to your laptop before class next week. You can find Mac and PC downloads [here](http://www.github.com/inkle/inky/releases/latest).

## Purchase Textbook
Please have a copy of Wonderbook by next week. Amazon currently has if for $13. There will be reading assignments periodically throughout the semester.

## Play Interactive Fiction samples
We'll begin talking about a specific genre of narrative game next week called Interactive Fiction, focusing on a selection of historical and contemporary examples. Here are a couple to get us started with.


### Colossal Cave Adventure (1976)
Play William Crowther's seminal Interactive Fiction (IF) game, Colossal Cave Adventure. There is an online port of the game which you can play [here](https://grack.com/demos/adventure/).

_You do not need to play to completion, but please play for at least 1 hour._

Also, the puzzles in this game can be... frustrating. Don't get too wrapped up in them unless that's really something you enjoy. In fact, [here's a walkthrough of the game](https://adventuregamers.com/walkthrough/full/colossal-cave) (you can find others online too). This is not a challenge to your _gamer cred_.

### Play either Counterfeit Monkey (2012) or Galatea (2000)
Play one of Emily Short's modern interactive fiction games, [Counterfeit Monkey]((https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=aearuuxv83plclpl)) or [Galatea](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=urxrv27t7qtu52lb).

_You do not need to play to completion, but please play for at least 1 hour._

_You can also play both of these if you like!_


### If you need help with these games...
Feeling stuck? Parser games such as these can be a little confusing at first. [Here](/docs/assets/documents/play-if-card.pdf) is a handy IF-for-beginners visual guide by Andrew Plotkin and Leah Albaugh that may help.

### Now what?? 
Take notes. What did you like? Dislike? Something that caused a reaction in you? Somethingn you didn't understand? Favorite moments?

__Come to class next week with a an open-ended discussion question related to each of the games you played.__ I'm not collecting these, we'll just be talking.

We'll also play some more games next week and you will use this as part of your first writing assignment (a reflection).




# Upcoming Events

## This Friday: Game Night at the MICA Game Lab! 6-9 PM

## Next Monday (09/04) 12-6:30 pm: Labor Day Game Jam.

MICA Start is hosting a small game jam for all students in the Game Lab (D220) on Labor Day. Sounds like a great opportunity to meet some new people, learn about MICA Start, and shake off some of that summertime rust from your Unity skills. 

Or maybe make a card game? Or a game about whispering outside? How about an "actually fun" ice breaker that we can use in classes? No experience needed. 

Help spread the word!
