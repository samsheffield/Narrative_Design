## What's this class?
We'll go over the syllabus together, which will hopefully be informative, but also hopefully the most boring thing we do this semester.

# Homework

## Install the Inky editor
Install the Inky editor to your laptop before class next week. You can find Mac and PC downloads [here](http://www.github.com/inkle/inky/releases/latest).

## Purchase Textbook
Please have a copy of Wonderbook by next week. Amazon currently has it for $15.99. There will be reading assignments periodically throughout the semester.We'll also keep a copy in the Game Lab (D220).

## Play Interactive Fiction samples
We'll begin talking about a specific genre of narrative game next week called Interactive Fiction, focusing on a selection of historical and contemporary examples. Here are a couple to get us started with.


### Colossal Cave Adventure (1976)
Play William Crowther's seminal Interactive Fiction (IF) game, Colossal Cave Adventure. There is an online port of the game which you can play [here](https://grack.com/demos/adventure/).

_You do not need to play to completion, but please play for at least 1 hour._

Also, the puzzles in this game can be... frustrating. Don't get too wrapped up in them unless that's really something you enjoy. In fact, [here's a walkthrough of the game](https://adventuregamers.com/walkthrough/full/colossal-cave) (you can find others online too). This is not a challenge to your _gamer cred_.

### Play Galatea (2000)
Play Emily Short's [Galatea](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=urxrv27t7qtu52lb).

_You do not need to play to completion, but please play for at least 1 hour._

### Play With Those We Love Alive
[With Those We Love Alive](https://xrafstar.monster/games/twine/wtwla/) by Porpentine

_A moving vignette of life in a mundane and monstrous world in which players are invited to draw sigils upon their own bodies._

__Have a pen/,marker (and paper if you don't want to draw on your body)__

_You do not need to play to completion, but please play for at least 1 hour._

### If you need help with these games...
Feeling stuck? Parser games such as the first two games can be a little confusing at first. [Here](https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/play-if-card.html) is a handy IF-for-beginners visual guide by Andrew Plotkin and Leah Albaugh that may help.

### Now what?? 
Take notes. What did you like? Dislike? Something that caused a reaction in you? Something you didn't understand? Favorite moments?

__Come to class next week with a an open-ended discussion question related to each of the games you played.__ I'm not collecting these, we'll just be talking.
