# UNITY INK INTEGRATION (1/2)

## Finish playtesting Environmental Storytelling games
This afternoon we are going to playtest the few remaining games before dinner. As a reminder, games should take no longer than 30 minutes to play. 

## Online Class Visit @ 7PM: Jenna Yow
MICA GMD Alum and Narrative Designer at KO_OP will be online with us at 7pm. Please be sure to get back from dinner a little early. We will be using our own individual computers, so please wear headphones if possible.

## Final Project (25%)
This is a freeform narrative assignment of your own choosing. It can be non-digital, interactive fiction, or something built in Unity/Unreal. 

_You must work with at least one other person unless you are creating web-based interactive fiction or a small physical game._

### Deliverables
The deliverables for this project are:
1. Playable prototype
2. Completed game
3. Documentation

#### Playable prototype (Due: 12/06)
A playable prototype of your game is due for in-class playtesting with your peers. _No deliverable due in Canvas._

#### Game uploaded to itch.io (Due: 12/13)
Upload your completed game to an itch.io page (for non-digital games, we will follow a similar set of guidelines to the Environmental Storytelling project). _Share that URL in the related Canvas assignment._

#### Documentation (Due: 12/17)
- 5-8 images of your game, which may include screenshots.
- Physical game: include a 60-90 second edited video of the game being played. _Share the URL to a Google Drive documentation folder in the related Canvas assignment._


## Unity Ink Workshop (1/2)
For people who are already familiar with Unity, we will be workshopping some introductory techniques for using Ink with Unity. 

You will need:
- An empty Unity Project
- A Unity Account to get [this asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/ink-integration-for-unity-60055) from the Asset Store.
- Alternative to the Asset Store: [Unitypackage from Github](https://github.com/inkle/ink-unity-integration/releases)


### Help!
I realize that we are introducing something new just before a break without any homework to practice. You'll forget the details(I would too!). I will provide a video demo of the workshop and a sample project with working scripts along with next week's class notes._ We'll also do a little review next time we meet.

### Not a Unity user?
_Anyone not interested in this is free to leave._ Keep in mind, this is a great time to catch up on any missing assignments you may have such as writing analysis.


# Homework

## Thanks Giving
We get a break! Enjoy it!

## Come up with an idea for your final project
After the break, we'll do a little more Unity + Ink integration and have time to work. Be sure to bring anything you need.
