# INK BASICS, PLOT, & CHOICE-BASED GAME PATTERNS

## Submit your online workspace/outline link to the class Canvas
Added last week's homework to our class Canvas Assignments list to streamline classwork submission for this class. 

### Already sent me the link via email?
If you emailed me your working directory's URL, please also submit the URL for the assignment on Canvas tonight before 10pm.

## Review

### Review: Getting started
1. Outline your plot (what are the significant moments, emotional beats, and how does the story unfold)
2. Establish a through-line (this is the shortest path through your game, which you can then complicate or make more interesting in iteration)
3. Have an ending, or endings (eventually, your player needs to end up somewhere. Don't wait to figure it out later!)
4. Test & revise (have others play your game and give feedback. Can they follow the plot? Were there memorable moments? Were there technical issues?)

### Review: Plot
A plot in a story is the series of events which unfold from start to finish ( a beginning, middle, and end). It expresses not only what happens but also how one event leads to another.

_Sam awoke in the middle of the night to the sound of dripping water to find that his house had flooded. He had to figure out how to quietly clean up the mess so that he wouldn't wake his child. Eventually, he was able to get things under control enough to go back to sleep._

This is very similar to a classic definition of a game:

_An easily achievable goal complicated with interesting obstacles._

### Review: Story Beats
We really raced through this last week (thanks, kidney stone!) so I wanted to make sure we spent a little more time discussing [this important narrative element](week2.md/#story-beats).

## Standard Patterns in Choice-Based Games
Let's talk about some common structural patterns for interactive fiction (and other choice-based game narratives). We'll use [this great resource](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/standard-patterns-in-choice-based-games/) by Sam Kabo Ashwell as a jumping off point.

## Exercise: Collective Outline
As a group, let's create an outline for a (very) short story. We'll...
- Create a basic plot
- Choose an ending or two
- Identify a few moments/emotional beats to create our through-line
- Add one choice
- Wrap everything up

## Review Text Game outlines together
Find a partner or two and take turns sharing your Ink story outlines (which should be playable, even though they are not complete). 

You can have people play your game through on your own computer. You do not need to play through all endings and you do not need to spend more than 10 minutes playing (in case someone has already exceeded the 10-15 minute maximum limit!)

After you play, write these things down and discuss with the author:
- Succinct description of the plot for the game you just played.
- Which ending did you arrive at?
- Did you encounter any issues that hindered/affected your playthrough? Anything unclear?
- Something you enjoyed or found interesting

## Ink Introduction Continues
Today we're going to continue focusing on the basics of using Ink and Inky. We'll start by reviewing some of the basics and then discuss how to create conditional choices.

### Cheatsheet for Ink
Here is a [cheatsheet](./assets/documents/ink-basics-cheatsheet.md) which will be updated to include all things Ink that we cover in this class. The [Ink Manual](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md) is also great and I would highly recommend getting comfortable with it to find examples of advanced Ink usage.

Today, we'll be focusing more on basics:
- Review (Knots, Diverts, 2 types of choices (and how to suppress them)
- Stitches
- Gather marks (-)
- Conditional choices
- Variable text

# Homework

## Finish Playing Modern Text-based Games
Please continue playing any of the modern text games that you did not finish in class today (Spend no more than 30 minutes on each, unless you find yourself enjoying a single game and want to play it longer)

## Complete Text Game: Write, Revise, and Test
Assignment details can be found [here](./assets/documents/complete-text-game.md)

### This week:
Use your outline as a guide to complete writing your short interactive fiction game. Make revisions as needed, possibly as a result of our outline review today. 

Before class next week, have at least one person play through your game to look for spelling or technical issues (or just to enjoy!). Observe where they end up.



## Create an itch.io Account
Next week we'll discuss how to export your game so that it can be played online. The hosting site we will use for this class is [itch.io](https://itch.io/).

We'll cover
- Exporting html from Inky
- Uploading interactive fiction games to play both online and offline
- Access control options, passwords, and download keys
