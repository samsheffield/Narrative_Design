# PLOTTING, OUTLINING, & PLAYTESTING

## Play homework games
### Review Text Game outlines together
Find a partner and take turns sharing your homework. Have something to take notes with.

After you play, write these things down and discuss with the designer:
- Describe/summarize your experience. 
- Describe anything which stood out (For example: Something that you liked, or that you thought was successful)
- Did you encounter any issues that hindered your experience? (For example: Was anything unclear? Did anything seem unfinished/unresolved? Any other technical issues like choices which didn't work?)
- Were there any notable spelling or grammar issues that you can recall?

## Playtesting
The process which you just engaged in is what game designers use to get feedback and test their designs. It is referred to as playtesting. 

When designing games, the goal is to test things early and often so that you can test your assumptions as designers and make corrections as needed.

## Narrative Design: Plotting & Outlining
 Without making a plan, just _finishing_ a game's narrative is sometimes the most challenging part. When you begin adding interactivity, or give a player choices, you will find yourself suddenly having a lot of story elements to craft.
 
 As with other kinds of writing, and outline is an effective tool for creating the underlying structure of your game's writing.

 _Note: We'll be focusing on Interactive Fiction games as examples at this point of the semester, but the processes we explore will be applicable to a broad set of narrative games._

### What's a plot?
A plot in a story is the series of events which unfold from start to finish ( a beginning, middle, and end). It expresses not only what happens but also how one event leads to another.

_The man woke up in the morning and experienced a number of unfortunate events which led him to arrive in the hospital instead of class as planned._

When even simplest of choices are added, the structure of a plot starts to resemble a classic definition of a game:

_An easily achievable goal complicated by interesting obstacles._

### Outlining the plot
Creating an outline of significant moments in your game and how a player moves from one to another is an important early step that can help you actually finish your game.

- The man wakes up in the morning and prepares for his normal work day.
- He has pains in his abdomen, which he tries to ignore.
- The pains become more severe.
- The man is alone at home so he calls a friend for advice.
- The man chooses to call an ambulance.
- The man is admitted to the hospital.

It's important not to become too obsessed with the details of each moment at this point. Just provide enough information about the moment and then figure out how it connects to the next one(s).

_In the example above, note that there is very little detail given about any particular moment. The outline is just creating the structure for the plot which will be expanded when the actually writing is done._


### What tools should you use?
You can quickly develop a simple plot on paper, or spread out on post-its or index cards, but you might consider software like [Milanote](https://milanote.com/) or [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) for something a little more flexible and persistent. _Don't overthink it. Pick something that seems to meet your needs and see how it goes._

I'd recommend the not sitting down directly in Inky to begin outlining. Work out the details outside of Inky and then transcribing it to avoid worrying about Ink's markup while coming up with your idea.

Two important things about this:
1. Focus on the through-line first.
2. Have an ending (or endings).

### Focus on the through-line first
The _through-line_ of your game is the direct path through it from beginning to the end which contains the significant turning points of the plot. Choices in games are exciting! But they can complicate your ability to focus on the story you want to tell.

Once you have the through-line in place, you can consider what you like and dislike about the structure and complicate the game little by little.

This approach is also nice because you start out with something that actually works and just becomes more interesting with iteration.

### Have an ending
When outlining your plot, have an ending. One of the biggest traps is to _figure it out later._ You might not. And it will be more challenging for you to figure out where to go if you don't have an idea where you are going!

You might even start writing near the ending, or backwards from the ending until you have a sense of the sequence of events leading to it.

Keep in mind with branching narratives (like with the first project) you will have multiple endings to contend with. How do you get to each one?

## Story Beats
Something else to consider: 

What kind of experience are you designing? 

Beats are emotional moments in game's story. Every scene will have at least one emotional beat, which are typically related to a character's ability to achieve internal or external goals. 

For example:

An external character goal (concrete in nature) might include:
- Finding treasure
- Rescuing a sibling
- Climbing to the top of a mountain

An internal character goal (emotional in nature) might include:
- Feeling financially secure
- Gaining approval from a sibling
- Being the first in the world to achieve something

As emotional moments, beats can either be _up beats_ (giving hope that a character will achieve their goals) or _down beats_ (making us fear they will not achieve their goals).

### Types of Beats
There are many types of beats. Here are some derived from Robin Law's Hamlet's Hit Points ([link](./assets/documents/beat-types.md))


# Homework

## Play the Following Interactve Fiction Games
- [A kiss](https://collection.eliterature.org/4/works/a-kiss/a-kiss.html#) by Dan Waber
- [Beautiful Frog](https://xrafstar.monster/games/twine/frog/) by Porpentine
- [Birdland](https://bphennessy.itch.io/birdland) by Brendan Patrick Hennessy

_Of these, Birdland is the only one which will require a significant investment of time to play. Please play for this one for at least one hour._

### Now what?? 
Take notes. What did you like? Dislike? Something that caused a reaction in you? Something you didn't understand? Favorite moments?

__Come to class next week with a an open-ended discussion question related to each of the games you played.__ I'm not collecting these, we'll just be talking.

## Plotting & Outlining Exercise
Create the plot summary and outline for a short Interactive Fiction game with the following simple premise:

_You must make a choice which leads to two very different outcomes._

You are not required to fully develop this in Ink. You are only required to produce the plot and outline for homework.


### Design Considerations:
- The game must have only two endings.
- There is no length requirement.
- Players will have two through-lines through the game. How do you balance these so that one is not the "good" ending?
- Create a plot summary and an outline using the tool of your choice.
- In the outline, indicate emotional beats and places where choices may be made.


### What to Turn In
If you do the outlining in Milanote or some other software: 
- You can share the URL in Canvas (if possible)
- You can export the outline and plot summary to a PDF and upload the file to the Canvas site.

If you use paper for outlining:
- Take a high resolution picture of the plot summary and outline and upload the file(s) to the Canvas site


# Over the Next Two Weeks
