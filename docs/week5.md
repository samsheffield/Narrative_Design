# EXPLORING MEDIA IN WEB-BASED INK STORIES
Today we're going to focus on some of the web-specific features that will allow you to do things like incorporate audiovisual media or connect to external websites.

## Updated Ink cheatsheet

Here are the notes from tonight's class [link](./assets/documents/ink-basics-cheatsheet.md#week-5)


## Play Hypertext fiction Selections
[Uncle Roger](https://people.well.com/user/jmalloy/uncleroger/partytop.html) by Judy Malloy (1986). [Image of disk](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/pathfinders/media/front-of-floppy-disk-for-a-party-in-woodside-by-judy-malloy)

_Intertwining elements of magic realism with Silicon Valley culture, semiconductor industry lore, and early word processing, Uncle Roger is a pioneering work of hypertext narrative poetry that was first published beginning in 1986 on Art Com Electronic Network on the WELL._

[Grammatron](https://www.grammatron.com/) by Mark Amerika (1997)

_A story about cyberspace, Cabala mysticism, digicash paracurrencies and the evolution of virtual sex in a society afraid to go outside and get in touch with its own nature._

_GRAMMATRON depicts a near-future world where stories are no longer conceived for book production but are instead created for a more immersive networked-narrative environment that, taking place on the Net, calls into question how a narrative is composed, published and distributed in the age of digital dissemination_


## Play Interactive Fiction Selection
[With Those We Love Alive](https://xrafstar.monster/games/twine/wtwla/) by Porpentine

_A moving vignette of life in a mundane and monstrous world in which players are invited to draw sigils upon their own bodies._

__Have a pen/,marker (and paper if you don't want to draw on your body)__


## Watch: La Jetee by Chris Marker (1962)
[Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvJzKqdSr-Q)

_A science fiction fairytale about time travel, memory, and loss told through photographs, music, and spoken narrative._ 

## Exercise: Source Material
Create a small story that has two distinct endings which stem from a single image or audio file (please no copyrighted materials!) One of the endings needs to be something the player arrives at by following a link. 

Upload the completed exercise to the class Canvas before leaving
- Export for web and zip the file before uploading

And...
- Exchange with at least one person in class and discuss
- Time permitting: Anyone want to share with the class?
