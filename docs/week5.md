# Standard Patterns in Choice-based Games

## Discuss this week's Interactive Fiction selections
- Break into small groups (3-4 people) and discuss the 3 games you played for homework.
- Use your notes and open-ended questions to drive the discussion.
- Share out as a larger group. 


### Cheatsheet for Ink
Here is a [cheatsheet](./assets/documents/ink-basics-cheatsheet.md) which will be updated to include all things Ink that we cover in this class. The [Ink Manual](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md) is also great and I would highly recommend getting comfortable with it to find examples of advanced Ink usage.

Today, we'll be focusing on the creation variation:
- Alternative text
- Generating random numbers
- Conditional blocks
- if/else if/else
- switch
- TODO:

## Project 1: Review Progress & Work Session
Projects are due next week, so get some work done today.


# Homework

## Project 1: Interactive Fiction

### Project Description
For this project, you will create a text-only short game with Ink that takes 10-15 minutes to play at most. Your game should have at least three significant endings, but subject matter is up to you to decide. 

_Donâ€™t spend too much time thinking about the perfect concept (masterpiece syndrome). Experimenting with structure and trying things out are more important than the originality of your premise._

Full project description [here](text-game-outline.md).

## Create an itch.io Account
Next week we'll discuss how to export your game so that it can be played online. The hosting site we will use for this class is [itch.io](https://itch.io/).

Next week, we'll cover
- Exporting games from from Inky
- Setting up itch.oi project page and uploading files
- Access control options, passwords, and download keys
