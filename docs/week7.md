# WORLDBUILDING & THE QUIET YEAR

## Discuss Citizen Sleeper
- Break into small groups (3-4 people) and discuss the game you played for homework.
- Use your notes and open-ended questions to drive the discussion.
- Share out as a larger group. 

## Worldbuilding
Worldbuilding is the process of constructing an imaginary setting with coherent qualities such as geography, history, and culture. It typically involves the creation of things such as backstory, inhabitants, architecture, flora and fauna, in order to understand the key relationships in the world. 

In game development, worldbuilding guides your choices as a gameplay designer/artist/narrative designer/animator/level design etc. __Not all of the information you create about your world will be shared directly with a player.__

### Worldview vs Storyview
The _worldview_ is all of the information you have about the setting you are creating as a designer. You will always know more about the world you are designing than a player.

The _storyview_ is what a player knows about the world you have designed. 

The differences between these two viewpoints can be a powerful tool for storytelling.

### Primary World vs Secondary World
You will often hear the term "secondary world" referred to when discussing worldbuilding. The term comes from JRR Tolkein's distinction between the real world (primary world) and the author's imagination (secondary world).

### Top-down vs Bottom-up
There are two methods of world-building: _top-down and bottom-up_.

Top-down worldbuilding starts with a general overview such as geographic layout, climate, history, and inhabitants, and then becomes more and more detailed. Everything starts with a wide lens and zooms in.

Bottom-up worldbuilding starts with the specific location, which is developed in great detail. Over time, the world is developed around this focal point.

Neither is inherently better than the other, but the viability of each approach is relative to your project's needs.

### Characteristics of a well-realized setting
Worldbuilding establishes the _setting_ of your narrative. This setting creates context for a player, providing an understanding of the world around them and how they relate to it.

- The setting exhibits __coherent and consistent logic__ (the details of the world fits together)
- The setting has a built-in __wider cause and effect__ (we understand motivations because of the larger historical/societal context)
- Good __strategic use of specific details__ (not contradictory or jarring)
- The setting impacts character's lives in surprising and interesting ways.
- The setting __mirrors our real world but also deviates from it__
- The setting is __somehow personal to you__ (focused on what makes a setting meaningful to you)
- The setting has sufficient __mystery and unexplored vistas__ (the unknown world provides a sense of adventure and discovery, while knowing everything feels boring)
- The setting __reflects that we live in a multicultural world__.
- The setting exhibits degrees of __"consistent inconsistency"__ (a farmer using oxen to plow a field while using a smartphone)
- The setting provides __opportunity for imperfect comprehension or miscommunication__. (creates nuanced layers of conflict between foreground and background elements)

### Dangers and opportunities of worldbuilding
- __Setting overshadows the characters__ (the world becomes so interesting that any characters and their actions feel less important)
- __"Fantastical Talismans"__ (novel objects) take too much of the focus and dominate other details of the story
- __Too much detail overwhelms other elements__. Environmental storytelling tasks a player with identifying patterns and too much detail can quickly cause things to shift from "What's this??" to "Who cares!"


### Game Development "Bibles"
Videogames (particularly commercial videogames) rely on worldbuilding as part of their documentation when pitching projects to ensure that their entire team is in alignment.

## Play Avery Alder's The Quiet Year
 This game can take anywhere between 2-4 hours to play, so be sure to play by the Fleeting Year rules: 
 
 _Before play, remove 5 cards from each suit. Make sure to remove the King of Diamonds(Summer), and make sure to keep the King of Spades(Winter) in the cards you play with._

### Discussion
 - Describe your group's experience playing The Quiet Year.
 - Is the collaborative worldbuilding of The Quiet Year an example of _top-down_ or _bottom-up_ worldbuilding?
 - How did the mechanics of the game (the repetitive, consequential actions) influence the storytelling
