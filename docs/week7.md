# PLAYTESTING INTERACTIVE FICTION

## Tonight: submit your itch.io links
In addition to adding the completed ink file to the online working folder you created for this project...
1. Submit the itch.io link to tonight's assignment in Canvas.
2. Post the itch.io link in our class Discord channel.

__Important:__ Please keep comments on for today's playtest (this may require you to temporarily make your game publicly available on itch.io).


## Review/playtest finished Interactive Fiction prototypes
Let's play your games!
- Share your links (and passwords on the Discord)
- Play as many games in the browser as time allows and leave feedback for the designer in the itch.io comments __and on the paper forms which I provide.__
- When you finish leaving feedback on all of your peers' games, you are free to leave!


### Guidelines for feedback
Online feedback:
- Can be more general in nature. What was successful? What could use more attention?

Paper feedback:
- Briefly summarize the plot for the game you just played.
- Describe the ending did you received.
- Note any issues that hindered/affected your playthrough, or anything else that was unclear.
- Describe one memorable moment. Something you enjoyed or found interesting.
- __Turn these in to me this evening before you leave.__ I will distribute them to each designer next class.
