# Text Game Project Description
For this project, you will create a text-only short game that takes _10-15 minutes to play at most_. Your game should have at least three significant endings, but subject matter is up to you to decide. Don’t spend too much time thinking about your concept. I’m more interested in you gaining experience in charting out the story of a game than the originality of your premise.

## Some General Advice on Finishing
- Don't over-complicate things!
- Make sure the through-line is covered and then add interesting choices/complications
- Can't figure something out? Replace it!
- Start as close to the end of your story as possible and work backwards.
- Don't obsess over making it "perfect".


## This Assignment
Expand your Ink game outline into a fully fleshed-out _prototype_. Your game should be playable start to finish, and contain no placeholder text. You can either re-use your outline in Ink (please make a copy of it) or start with a fresh .ink file.

### Testing
Have at least one other person play your game to check for any spelling/grammar issues, technical issues which hamper their ability to complete the game, or general feedback on their experience playing it (does it connect in the ways you imagine?) 

If you struggle with spelling or grammar, you are responsible for reaching out to the [Writing Studio](https://www.mica.edu/student-resources/writing-studio/) for assistance. 

### Name your game
Things are getting real now! Come up with a name for your game and name the .ink file to include this name (see below).


### What to turn in next week

Upload the .ink file to the online workspace folder you created for this project. _Do not export it for the web._ 

Name the file like this:

`yourname_name_of_game_beta.ink`

__You do not need to export your game. We'll do that next week together in class.__ 

Next week you'll also submit the URL to your game's itch.io page as an Assignment in Canvas.
