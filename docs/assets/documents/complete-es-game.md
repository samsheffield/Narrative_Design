# Environmental Storytelling Project (Due 11/08)
For this project, you will create a non-digital and/or site specific game or interactive experience that tells a narrative primarily through objects that you find or make. 

## This assignment
For next week, you only need to have your completed project ready to play in class. You will do all of the documentation as homework next week.

I would also recommend...
1. Playtesting your completed game one more time outside of class.
2. Having a camera (or charged phone) available to take pictures of your project being played by others.


## Some Reminders

### Collaboration
If you are working collaboratively (recommended), one shared Google Drive folder to serve as your team's online workspace.

### Written materials
You may use written materials in your work as long as it makes sense thematically. You could. of course, tell a story by having the player read a book in-game, but this is an easy way out. Think about how objects in your own life tell a story indirectly.

### Public space
Please make sure that if you are creating something for a specific space that you actually have permission to use that space. For instance, a lot of spaces on-campus are not available for setting up installations of work without prior permission (I can't give you permission to set up anything off this floor).

### Secret(s)
One design challenge for you was to include some secret information that was revealed to a player later.
