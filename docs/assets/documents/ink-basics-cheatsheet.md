## Anatomy of Ink script
Ink will always start from the top of your file and work its way down. 


### Knots
A story is comprised of multiple linked sections that are referred to as [knots](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md#3-knots).

These are marked up sections of content with unique names.

These are the fundmental structural element of ink content.

A knot looks like this:

`== knot_name ==`

The name needs to contain no spaces. You also need at least 2 equal signs on at least the left hand side (both is easier to read).

### Diverts
The story can be moved from knot to knot using divert arrows ([diverts](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md#4-diverts))

A divert looks like this:

`-> name_of_knot`

### END knot
The END knot indicates the end of your content. You do not create content for END, you just send the You always want to make sure that your knots divert to an end like this:

`-> END`

### Choices

Choices are the type of input offered to players via Ink. There are two types of [choices](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md#2-choices) in Ink.

The standard way of creating a non-repeating choice is to use a `*` .

The other way, which allows you to reuse a choice is with a `+` . This is helpful, for instance, if you want to send a player back to a knot and have all choices available and repeatable.

A choice looks like this:

`* Say hello. -> name_of_knot`

#### Suppressing choices
Normally, making a choice echoes the text from the choice before the content from the knot. To only display the text from the next knot you can [supress the choice text](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md#suppressing-choice-text) with `[]`.

For example:

`[Say hello.] -> hello_knot`

#### Combining choice and output
This approach can be used to combine choices with output text, for example, when writing dialogue choices:

```
How are you?
*	"I'm fine[."]," I responded.
	"Oh, that's nice", he replied.
```

### Comments
If you want to leave comments for yourself, which will not appear to your players you can use either 

`// followed by the comment` for a single line or

```
/* 
 many 
 lines 
 of 
 comments
*/
 ```
