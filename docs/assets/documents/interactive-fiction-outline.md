# Interactive Fiction Project Description
For this project, you will create a web-based game with Ink that uses both text and media* (either visuals or audio, or a combination both!) to explore a narrative. It can take 10-15 minutes to play _at most_. You may not work with another student for this project. 

*_You are also invited to explore a combination of web-based narrative and offline media as long as the media is downloadable via your itch.io page or self-generated by the player._

## Some General Advice on Getting Started
- Focus on one central character instead of a large cast.
- Don't procrastinate. Make big things happen immediately.
- Start as close to the end of your story as possible.
- Don't obsess over finding the "right" concept.
- Do not focus on creating "finished" audiovisuals before you have your narrative structured.

## This Assignment
1. First outline your game on paper (or digitally outside of Inky).
    - Establish the ending(s), the key plot points, and then create the throughline. This can be done diagrammatically, or written out in a tet document.

2. Outline your game in Ink. 
    - Each knot you create in your outline will be a stand-in for a single dramatic beat or key plot development (likely both), and should only be 1-3 sentences explaining what occurs at that point. 

    - Each knot should also indicate the type of dramatic beat (according to the Hamlet’s Hit Points rubric) in its text in parentheses. 
    - Even in outline form, your game should be playable, so use diverts -> to connect == knots == (and -> END diverts as necessary to end the game).

3. Use placeholder images or notes to indicate where media will be embedded.
    - Do not include any finished artwork that you produce for this game.
    - If you are using external IRL media, you will need to produce placeholders for this as well.

### Example
Here’s an example of what a passage from your .ink outline might look like:

```
== intro ==

# IMAGE: placeholder.jpg
Link at long last is able to lift the Master Sword from the platform in front of the Deku Tree.
He's ready to take on Ganon.

* He decides to go to Hyrule castle. -> go_to_hyrule_castle
* He decides to hunt down the last remaining memory. -> hunt_down_the_memory
```


### Try things out
The goal of this outline is to give yourself a good foundation, not to lock you into choices. When you develop it into a small game next week, you're free to change the story as much as necessary.


### What to turn in next week

Upload both the .ink file and non-Ink outline to the online project folder you create for review. _Do not export it for the web at this point._ 

Name the file like this:

`yourname_interactivefiction_outline.ink`


This outline submission will be factored into your total grade for the project. Points will be deducted for submissions which do not have emotional beats notated or that prioritize audiovisuals over narrative outlining.
