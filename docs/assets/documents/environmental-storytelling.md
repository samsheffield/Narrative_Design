# Environmental Project (Due 11/08)
For this project, you will create a non-digital and/or site specific game or interactive experience that tells a narrative primarily through objects that you find or make. 

## The deliverables for this project are:

Playable game or interactive experience that...
- Consists of at least eight significant objects (Limit yourself to less than a dozen objects)
- Is not played on a computer, smartphone, etc.
- Takes no longer than 30 minutes to play.
- Includes at least one secret: the entire story must not be initially accessible to the player. How much work that secret takes to discover is up to you.

An itch.io page which includes…
- 5-8 images of your game’s various objects and of it being played
- 60-90 second video documentation of your game being played
- A short text-based description of the game, including content and how it is played

### Collaboration
You may work independently, but it’s recommended to work in teams of 2-3 people for this project. Create one shared Google Drive folder to serve as your team's online workspace.

### Written materials
You may use written materials in your work as long as it makes sense thematically. You could. of course, tell a story by having the player read a book in-game, but this is an easy way out. Think about how objects in your own life tell a story indirectly.

### Public space
Please make sure that if you are creating something for a specific space that you actually have permission to use that space. For instance, a lot of spaces on-campus are not available for setting up installations of work without prior permission (I can't give you permission to set up anything off this floor).

## Some General Advice on Getting Started
- Think about (and design) the space that these objects exist as much as the objects themselves. Are the objects in a specific room

- The scale of the game is up to you. The entire game could be rooting through a lunchbox, the evidence locker for a murder case, or an entire stairwell.

- Spend some time thinking about how you will tell your story, especially how you'll hide the secret part of your story.

### Experiment
This project is an experiment in narrative design. We're going to view "games" from an expansive lens that centers play and agency as central to the experiences we have with them. I don't know where you are going to end up (and my assumption is hat you don't either!) As long as you put in the effort to make something _you_ think is interesting or fun, you really can't do this wrong. Don't overthink it.


## This Week's Assignment

### Begin worldbuilding
Begin doing the worldbuilding for this project. Start with a bottom-up approach and determine:
- What are the key objects? What do you know about them? What does a player know about them? (Worldview vs storyview)
- What is kept secret from the player? Why?
- What do they say about the setting or character(s) you are telling a story about?
- How do they relate in a way that communicates something cohesive to a player?

### Begin gathering/making the objects you need
You need objects and a way to transport them. Find a box. Do not select anything that you do not want to/can't bring with you unless they are connected to a public site you want to work with. _You will need to bring these with you next week to demonstrate how you imagine them working together._

### Create a simple outline
Outline what the story is that you are trying to tell through interaction with the objects. Is it linear? Is it nonlinear? How will the secret ultimately be revealed to the player?

### For next week (11/01)
1. Create an online workspace (Google Drive) and share the link on the class Canvas. 
2. Share your worldbuilding and outlining documents in the folder.
3. Bring your objects.

Also, if you are working with others, let me know.
