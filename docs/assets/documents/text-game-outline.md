# Interactive Fiction Project Description
For this project, you will create a small text-based game that takes 10-15 minutes to play at most. Your game should have at least three significant endings.

_Don’t spend too much time thinking about your concept. I’m more interested in you gaining experience in charting out the story of a game than the originality of your premise._

## Some General Advice on Getting Started
- Focus on one central character instead of a large cast.
- Don't procrastinate. Make big things happen immediately.
- Start as close to the end of your story as possible.
- Don't obsess over finding the "right" concept.


## Phase 1 (Due 09/25)
__Planning phase. Do not work with Ink this week.__

- Draft a written plot summary for your game. Who are we? Where are we? What happens?
- Outline your game on paper or using software like Milanote. The outline should identify key events, their emotional beats, and the through-lines in your narrative.

For each event you create in your outline:
- Write 1-2 sentences explaining what occurs at this moment. 
- Note the type of dramatic beat (according to the Hamlet’s Hit Points rubric).

### Try things out
The goal of this outline is to give yourself a good foundation, not to paralyze you with descisions and details. Give yourself enough information to create a structure for your writing. When you develop it into something playable next week, you will make changes as necessary.


### What to turn in on 09/25

If you do the outlining in Milanote or some other software: 
- You can share the URL in Canvas (if possible).
- You can export the outline and plot summary to a PDF and upload the file to the Canvas site.

If you use paper for outlining:
- Take a high resolution picture of the plot summary and outline and upload the file(s) to the Canvas site.


__This outline submission will be factored into your total grade for the project (50%).__

## Phase 2 (Due 10/02)
__Development phase. Work with Ink.__

Expand your game's outline into a fully fleshed-out _prototype_ using Ink. Your game should be playable start to finish, and contain no placeholder text or dead ends.

### Proofreading
If you struggle with spelling or grammar, you are responsible for reaching out to the [Writing Studio](https://www.mica.edu/student-resources/writing-studio/) for assistance. 

### Name your game
Things are getting real now! Come up with a name for your game and name the .ink file to include this name (see below).

### What to turn in on 10/02

Upload the .ink file to the Canvas assignment for this week. 

Name the file like this:

`yourname_name_of_game_beta.ink`

__You do not need to export your game for itch.io. We'll do that next week together in class.__
