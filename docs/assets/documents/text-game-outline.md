# Text Game Project Description
For this project, you will create a text-only short game that takes 10-15 minutes to play at most. Your game should have at least three significant endings, but subject matter is up to you to decide. Don’t spend too much time thinking about your concept. I’m more interested in you gaining experience in charting out the story of a game than the originality of your premise.

## Some General Advice on Getting Started
- Focus on one central character instead of a large cast.
- Don't procrastinate. Make big things happen immediately.
- Start as close to the end of your story as possible.
- Don't obsess over finding the "right" concept.


## This Assignment
Outline your game in Ink. Each knot you create in your outline will be a stand-in for a single dramatic beat, and should only be 1-3 sentences explaining what occurs in the beat. Each knot should also have the type of dramatic beat (according to the Hamlet’s Hit Points rubric) in its text in parentheses. Even in outline form, your game should be playable, so use diverts -> to connect == knots == (and -> END diverts as necessary to end the game).

Here’s an example of what a passage from your outline might look like:

```
== intro ==
Link at long last is able to lift the Master Sword from the platform in front of the Deku Tree.
He's ready to take on Ganon.

* He decides to go to Hyrule castle. -> go_to_hyrule_castle
* He decides to hunt down the last remaining memory. -> hunt_down_the_memory
```

If you want to use more complicated logic in your story (for example, things happening based on something that happened much earlier in the game), just write out what you want to do in your outline. We will talk about it next week in class.

### Try things out
The goal of this outline is to give yourself a good foundation, not to lock you into choices. When you develop it into a small game next week, you're free to change the story as much as necessary.


### What to turn in next week

Upload the .ink file to the online project folder you create for review. _Do not export it for the web._ 

Name the file like this:

`yourname_textgame_outline.ink`


This outline submission will be factored into your total grade for the project.
