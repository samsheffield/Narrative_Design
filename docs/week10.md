# ENVIRONMENTAL STORYTELLING WORK SESSION

## Let's talk about MYST

Myst is an adventure video game designed by the Robyn and Rand Miller brothers, Robyn and Rand(Cyan, Inc.), initially released in 1993 for the Macintosh.

It was their first attempt to create a game targeted towards adults, amrking a departure from their earlier work with games like [The Manhole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyOTq1EpV5o) from 1988.

The game is a first-person exploration featuring nonlinear storytelling, non-violent activity, and environmental puzzle solving developed using [hypercard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard), application building software for early Mac computers which didn't require programming that operated something like an interactive stack of cards. 

_Fun fact: Some people are [still making games with Hypercard!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOyQU0oRvs8&t=9s)_

### Legacy

Myst is considered one of the greatest video games ever made. It sold more than 6 million copies and inspired many genres and video game conventions 

- New category of point-and-click adventure games (even Sierra On-line had their own [Myst-like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrmNgq9EUtY))

- "Casual games" (non-violent, slow paced, gentle puzzle-oriented games) and *escape room games (*the first escape room game was [Crimson Room](https://archive.org/details/crimsonroom_flash) by Toshimitsu Takagi)

- Walking simulators such as [Dear Esther](https://www.thechineseroom.co.uk/games/dear-esther) and the [Stanley Parable](https://www.stanleyparable.com/)



## Review Progress & Playtest

- Have at least two other people play/interact with your project
    - Just observe and take notes. (This is the hard part)
        - Did it work as expected?
        - Were they confused at any point?
        - How can you improve it?
- I will also playtest your work and discuss planning/goals with you.

# Homework

## Play Modern Graphical/Point & Click Adventure Games
Over the next two weeks, choose one of the games below to play for at least one hour.
- [Kentucky Route Zero](http://kentuckyroutezero.com/) by Cardboard Computer
- [Norco](https://rawfury.com/games/norco/) by Geography of Robots

_Both of these games are on the Game Lab PC's Steam account, but you are welcome to purchase them for your own research as well._

## Text Game Analysis (Due in two weeks)
For this assignment, you will write a brief analysis of Maniac Mansion or Myst and the modern text games you played (Kentucky Route Zero and Norco). Please donâ€™t summarize the games. Instead, use your word count to talk about:

- What is notable about the modern games you played from a design standpoint?
- What differences do you observe between these three games? What do they say about how the genre has changed over time?
- What are their similarities? Why do you think these aspects have remained as part of the genre?
- In what ways is one game more effective than the other?
- How do the design goals (not the game play goals) differ between the games? Why do you think the designers chose those?
